SQL Joins:

  Regular Joins: retain every input row as part of the join to potentially join it with the other table in the future
  
  Interval Joins: join considering a specific interval to reduce the records needed in state
  	
  	each set is divided into intervals (start and end time)
  	
  	join the input based on an interval of the other set
  	
  	FROM orders o
  	JOIN shipments s ON o.id = s.order_id
  	WHERE
  	  o.order_time BETWEEN s.shipment_time - INTERVAL '3' DAY AND s.shipment_time;
  	  
  	  
  Lookup Joins: join with  a static set 
  	
  			  The join requires one table to have a processing time attribute and the other table to be backed by a lookup source connector, like the JDBC connector.
  			  The lookup join also requires an equality join predicate based on the PRIMARY KEY of the lookup table (usub.user_id = u.user_id)
  			  
  			  
  			  
  			  FROM subscriptions usub
  			  JOIN users FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF usub.proc_time AS u
  			    ON usub.user_id = u.user_id;
