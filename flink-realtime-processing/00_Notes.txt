Realtime processing challenges:

    Unbounded data: new data always comes to unpredictable way 
    Repeatability of results: the same query executed 5 mins back will return different results if executed again
    Results expirations: results are expired after an amount of time and needs to recalculated
    State managment: 
    Latency: 
    Resource requirments:


Flink:

    Native streaming technology
    Array of connectors (hdfs, kafka...)
    Event time processing
    Exactly once consistency
    Low latency
    Hight availability (snapshots)


Datastream API: 

    Datastream API represend an unbounded data stream
    Support map and reduce operations
    Support Windows
    Support event time processing
    State managment
